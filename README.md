you can run ape-x dqn by
```
python apexdqn.py
```

I use distribution value, for more information in [qrdqn](https://github.com/LihaoR/qr-dqn)

something wrong in Prioritised Experience Replay, but it doesn't matter the convergence of this algorithm.

Since I can't run it with 360 actors, so I don't know if it can perform so good as the paper said
