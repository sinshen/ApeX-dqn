# apexdqn
asynchronousdqn work, 16 actors, after several hours

much slower than a3c

update apex dqn, distributed prioritized experience replay, didnt test

asynchronousdqn is almost like a3c, asydqn_rm added replay memory, multi-step will be even faster than a3c

if there are not many actors, apexdqn will not perform better than others(deepmind used 360 actors)
